EnergyEne Inc.,Enhanced Radiation Attenuation Medical Gloves,Department of Agriculture,,Phase I,SBIR,"$99,914.00 ",3,,Wooster,OH,44691-9665,Katrina Cornish ,Chief Science Officer / CEO,(330) 262-0159,KatrinaCornish@EnergyEne.com,Thomas R Fontana ,Chief Operating Officer / PI,(330) 262-0159,tomfontana@energyene.com,,,,"Guayule,Circumalergenic Latex,Radiation Attenuation Medical Gloves","High margin, low volume, specialty rubber product markets are critical to early stage commercialization of guayule natural rubber, a domestic rubber source. Current guayule production is too small to achieve economies of scale and cannot compete in the low cost, high volume, commodity markets. This project exploits the unique mechanical properties of guayule latex to develop the first radiation attenuation (RA) medical glove, a high performance/high value product. Existing RA gloves, made from latex tapped from the rubber tree, are classified as personal protective equipment, because the required loading of attenuation filler reduces glove mechanical properties below FDA medical glove performance requirements. FDA mandates that health care workers using ionizing radiation, double-glove with both an RA glove (to reduce their exposure to radiation) and a medical glove (to protect them from blood-borne pathogens) to the clear detriment of tactile sensitivity and patient outcomes. The intrinsic softness and elasticity of guayule latex allows combined high RA filler loading and glove performance that exceeds FDA requirements. A pair of natural latex RA gloves contains approximately 24g of natural rubber while commanding a price of $40-60/pair. Guayule RA medical gloves would certainly be positioned at the upper end of this range, because they could be used without double gloving and transmit a higher level of tactile sensation than current RA gloves (even without double-gloving). We can enter this market using our pilot plant capacity and demand is sufficient to support the construction of a commercial scale latex production facility with associated guayule acreage."

Maintaining the health of these animals is of critical importance to good human nutrition worldwide. Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is an important immunosuppressive pathogen of poultry. We are proposing to improve vaccines and diagnostics for this pathogen to improve animal health. Chicken infectious anemia (CIA) is the disease caused by CAV, a ubiquitous virus found in all poultry producing regions worldwide. CAV has been controlled by vaccinating breeder flocks one time with a live attenuated vaccine at about 12 weeks of age. The resulting maternal immunity is transferred to chicks and protects them against CAV during the critical early development of their immune systems. However, the immunity to CAV in the breeder flock declines over time, leaving chicks vulnerable to infection. A vaccine is needed that can be used multiple times to create a longer lasting immunity to CAV in breeder flocks. Although CAV often causes only a subclinical disease in young chicks, the resulting infection results in reduced growth rate, poor feed efficiency, lower weight uniformity and most importantly immune suppression that leaves chicks susceptible to secondary and opportunistic infections.Vaccine companies are currently producing live CAV vaccines in cell culture or embryonated chicken eggs. In addition to being expensive and time consuming, the quantity of antigen produced through this method is highly variable. In the poultry vaccine market, profit margins are very tight. Producing CAV vaccine using conventional methods is not only expensive but is a bottleneck in the production of these vaccines that can cause an inability to meet market demand. CAV vaccine manufacturers have also had problems with CAV contamination in their other vaccines. This has caused some very expensive decontamination efforts and loss of the contaminated vaccine lots. Our proposal to produce a CAV vaccine using genetic engineering is one solution to these problems. No infectious CAV is ever used in our system and production quality and quantity is improved."

The problem persists into the storage phase where the value of raw commodities is reduced by direct damage. Thus sensing and eliminating insect pests must be accomplished to ensure not only the retention of maximum value of the crop but also to permit the safe movement of agricultural commodities from infested and/or infected areas to those that are not. In addition, stored grains like corn, wheat, and rice as well as nuts and fruits and tobacco are processed into value-added products that are susceptible to insect attack. Traditionally, post&shy; harvest pest control has been achieved predominantly through use of methyl bromide and other fumigants. The strategic use of post-harvest fumigants is required due to human and environmental health regulations. If insect infestations can be sensed before the onset of damage, via the technologies and cooperation in this project, a reduction in the amount of fumigant used for disinfestation, a reduction in the frequency of fumigation, and an increase in fumigation efficiency is expected.This project focuses on the Indianmeal moth and its larvae. The Indianmeal moth is the most common stored product insect found throughout the U.S. Adult Indianmeal moths can be found almost anywhere in the temperate regions of the world. In the U.S. and Europe it is the one insect pest that causes the most damage. The economic losses from these pests in processing, transporting and storing can be in the millions of dollars per contamination incident, product recall, consumer complaint/litigation, and pest control applications. Yet there is no efficient, low cost method to monitor and sense Indianmeal moths.The Indianmeal moth is most often found feeding on finished food products, the ingredients for food such as stored wheat products, milled/processed wheat, and other stored products such as milled cereal products, flour, bran, pasta products, spices or infesting equipment where food is prepared, processed, packaged or stored. Indianmeal moth larvae are the destructive life stage of the insect, eating voraciously. The larvae are highly mobile and continuously seek out new sources of food. While there are no direct health concerns, the psychological health of an individual knowingly consuming these larvae can have dramatic impacts and consequences including legal costs for the retailer, distributor or manufacturer of the product. It is the oneinsect found more often than any other on stored food and grain in the U.S. Over fifty years the genetics of this insect have changed to resist the commonly used pesticide Malathion. In the 1970&#39;s, the Indianmeal moth started showing signs of resistance to this insecticide. Since then, the Indianmeal moth has become the most resistant insect known to man. As the other insect competitors for the same habitat and food sources were slower to develop this genetic resistance to Malathion, the Indianmeal moth emerged as the primary pest of stored products.SDC&#39;s objective in this project is to develop an affordable and accurate device that can detect Indianmeal moth and Indianmeal moth larvae in stored products. No other technology has been shown to sense larvae in stored products. SDC&#39;s technology is pioneering. The SDC device will provide early warning of insects in food processing and storage to help prevent infestation and control populations and drastically reduce the need for hazardous chemicals in the food industry. The primary goal of this project is to implement SDC&#39;s innovative nano-tin oxide sensor technology to sense pheromones and semiochemicals, chemicals given off by insects to communicate with other insects. SDC will sense these chemicals simultaneously at very low levels and to differentiate between them and other gases in the air. SDC anticipates that if the project is successful the most damaging insect of stored products will be"

IPM machines use high energy density rare earth based magnet materials such as neodymium and dysprosium. Variable flux (VF) machines using abundant and cheaper soft magnets such as AlNiCo feature better efficiency at moderate and high speed than IPM machines. Though a number of works have been published to demonstrate the benefits using VF machines versus IPM machines for vehicle application in lab environment, the mathematical modeling, control strategies, and design methodology for VF machines, very little work can be found to prove the reliability of VF machines from a real-world vehicle application point of view. Despite all the advantages of VF machines mentioned above, several major reliability-related application issues need to be solved before VF machines can be adopted for high volume HEV/EV production. In this Phase I STTR project, the potential technical and economic barriers and solutions to apply VF machines to the vehicle traction application will be investigated. Experimental methods will be used to understand the demagnetization and magnetization behavior of various grades of AlNiCo magnets under a wide range of operating temperature, how repeated demagnetization and magnetization process will affect reliability, how to implement online demagnetization and magnetization of the VF machine without interrupting the vehicle operation. A100-kW VF machine will be designed that uses multiple grades of AlNiCo magnets so both high power density and easy control of the demagnetization and magnetization of magnets can be achieved. Additionally, a silicon-carbide based power converter will be designed for the proposed VF machine. Finally, a cost analysis for a VF machine and drive system will be developed, a reliable supplier and manufacturer chain will be assembled to prepare for the 100-kW VF machine prototype construction in Phase II, and the proposed technology and research results will be disseminated to automotive OEMs."

The center piece of the innovation is the wide bandgap semiconductor betavoltaic power source, essentially an innovative nuclear-based micro-battery. The energy storage density of this power source is estimated to be three orders of magnitude greater than conventional NiMH battery technology. This power innovation will be combined with the very latest in ultra low power electronics and energy harvesting circuitry to realize sensors that are effectively self-powered for the useful life of device. The betavoltaic power source will enable the realization of the ?Internet-of-Things? vision by solving the power challenge, supporting the public good through enhanced safety and security, improved mobility and support for new and disruptive business ventures. The proposed project will attempt to solve a portion of the power challenge that today limits the implementation and scale of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Experts predict billions and possibly trillions of ""things"" connected by IoT technologies. This requires transformative advances in the science, technology, and engineering. The proposed betavoltaic power source will achieve advancements in all three areas, focused on the power challenge. Although research papers have been published on micro nuclear batteries, the power levels of the previous implementations are insufficient for broad market application. Through the use of novel fabrication techniques and optimal material selection and placement, the proposed power source will achieve at least an order of magnitude improvement in power efficiency over any previous result achieved, with target power efficiency level in excess of 30%. This surpasses the breakout power level required for mass adoption of the new power source. Work on this power source will result in new technology development for enhancing the efficiency of nuclear micro-battery. New semiconductor material processing and fabrication techniques related to the incorporation of radioactive materials will be developed as well as greater understanding of wide band gap semiconductor material behavior under irradiation as applied to radiation-hardened electronics."

Accurate and timely measurement of nuclear reactor neutron flux density is critical to monitoring and controlling the nuclear reaction process.The current state-of-the-art in nuclear reactor neutron flux density monitoring centers on in-core metal SPNDs or gas-filled fission chambers for in-core measurements (usually at a single remote location) and additional neutron detectors, such as fission or ion chambers in various ex-core locations. Current drawbacks with this status quo include: (1) Accuracy suffers due to the SPND sensitivity to both neutrons and gamma rays; (2) Gaps in neutron flux density measurements. Gaps in the flux density field surrounding the core and at specific distances from the core, require interpolation of values that results in measurement inaccuracies; (3) Relatively slow response of SPND ranging from seconds to minutes, times which are characteristically ill suited for safety monitoring; (4) Large volume (large form factor), usually much longer than 10 centimeters for fission chambers. This limits where detectors can be placed; (5) Highly enriched fissile materials are required for fission chambers. This proposal seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in neutron flux density measurement by proposing the development of an intelligent III-V GaN-based neutron flux detector array. This sensor array would augment the current in-core detectors. Phase I will develop a “small” array configuration of multiple detectors that will prove the concept. Detailed advantages of the proposed technology will be measured in a test nuclear reactor setting. This can later be scaled to fully envelope the reactor core as part of Phase II. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:AAT believe that the core technology developed as part of the Phase I and Phase II efforts will be directly applicable to superior, low power radiation detection via widely distributed semi-conductor detectors. There is a broad market that a modified version of a low power radiation detector array can serve. Use cases in boarder security and smart city security are very much in line with the potential of the proposed technology."

The goal of this SBIR project is to develop an innovative SA PCPE PCR technology that can simultaneously
genotype multiple mutated mononucleotide STRs in a vast background of wild type DNAwhich will be
employed to develop an assay for liquid biopsy of high frequency microsatellite instabilityMSI HcancerThe hallmark of MSI H is extensive instability in short tandem repeatSTRwhich alters the repeat numberExamination of five mononucleotide STRs is currently recommended for the MSI classificationTargeted cancer treatment is emerging as an effective approach to cancer care because it allows doctors to
select the right treatment for the right patient at the right time based on a genetic understanding of tumorBecause MSI H has different profiles than microsatellite stableMSStumorstheir treatment differs from
each otherRecentlyFDA approved the first two drugs that are tailored to MSI H treatmentFor exampleFDA granted an accelerated approval of Keytruda to a treatment for patients with MSI HUntil thenFDA
approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started for examplelung or breast
cancersKeytruda is the first approved drug based on a tumorandapos s biomarkerMSI Hwithout regard to the
tumorandapos s original locationLiquid biopsy is a method enabling doctors to discover a range of information about a tumor through a blood
sampleand detecting mutations in cell free DNAcfDNAis emerging as the method of choice of liquid
biopsyTargeted treatment is one of its most important application areasBecause of its values to targeted
cancer treatmentvarious liquid biopsy assays as the accompany test for targeted treatment have been or
are being developedFor exampleFDA has approved liquid biopsy tests for targeted EGFR treatmentClearlyliquid biopsy will be equally valuable to targeted MSI H treatmentHoweverno liquid biopsy test is
available for targeted MSI H cancer treatment because of the lack of technologies that can detect the
biomarker of MSI H in a sensitivespecificand cost effective mannerHereinwe propose a novel method termed SA PCPE PCR to address this unmet needThis method
solves two of the fundamental problems plaguing the detection of mutated STRs in cfDNAFirstit enriches
multiple mutated STRs simultaneously prior to PCRThis solves the problem of PCR slippagesrendering it
possible to genotype mutated STRs in a vast background of wild type DNA using fragment analysisSecondit manipulates fragment size of amplicons by introducing size tagscreating a sufficient difference
in length of the ampliconsThis solves the size constraint problems imposed by cfDNAmaking it possible
to genotype multiple STRs based on the unique size of each ampliconA SA PCPE PCR assay consists of
three stepsFirsta DNA sample is subjected to SA PCPEwhich preferentially produces amplifiablelongextension products from mutant allelesenriching mutants prior to PCRwhile introducing size tags to
these extension productsSecondmultiplexed PCR is performed with extension products as templatesbut
only long extension products are amplifiedFinallysize adjusted amplicons are fragment analyzed by a
conventional DNA sequencer to identify mutated STRsIn this studywe will first develop a SA PCPE PCR
assay to detect five mutated mononucleotide STRs simultaneously in a large background of wild type DNAThenwe will assess the detection limit and reproducibility of the assayFinallywe will assess the clinical
detection sensitivity and specificity of the assayClearlysuccess of this project can provide a liquid biopsy

Concussion causes significant and often lasting impairments in vestibular function affecting balance (Haran 2016) and dynamic visual acuity (Kelley 2015; Gottshall 2007). Vestibular rehabilitation (i.e. gaze stabilization exercises, GSE) improves impairments but only if done intensely, 2-3 times per day for up to 20 minutes (Hall 2016). Currently, GSE are completed with the service men and women (SMW) focusing on a stationary letter while turning the head quickly (> 2Hz or 120deg/sec) but maintaining visual focus for 1-2 minutes (Hall 2016). The problem with this method is that it is not engaging and there is no way to control whether the SMW are turning the head quickly enough to induce recovery. SMW are often in the field or away from a skilled clinician. Therefore, there is a need for a portable device to deliver skilled vestibular rehabilitation in the field. The device must be durable, accurately measure activity and enable a clinician to remotely adjust parameters. The exercises must engage SMW and be challenging to induce meaningful change."

Cell separation is a $3.9 billion/yr market with applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, many current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. The nanoparticle reagent developed by this research possesses magnetic properties to enable cell separation, and fluorescent properties that allow properties of separated cells to be quantified. This research will optimize this product and demonstrate proof-of-concept against the current standard approaches. The proposed product is the result of basic research previously funded by the NSF into methods to combine magnetic and fluorescent reagents, and optimization of this reagent will yield basic knowledge in manufacture and scale-up of these nanomaterials. Successful completion of these goals will lead to a new product that will enable cell separation and analysis with a single reagent, enabling cell separation with high purity and increasing signal used for quantification. These benefits could translate into reduced laboratory healthcare costs with increased diagnostic efficiency, improved pharmaceutical purity, and high tech nanomanufacturing jobs in this burgeoning industry. This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents to enable seamless cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; however, analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads for separation prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the protein quantified. Even if small nanoparticles are used, a separate reagent is required for analysis, and signal is limited as the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Thus, a reagent that could perform both separation and analysis steps would improve performance. This research will optimize nanoparticle reagents that enable separation and analysis and compare their performance to the current approach using two separate reagents. Thus, this research will demonstrate crucial proof-of-concept of these reagents that are manufactured using a scalable process, enabling rapid transition to beta testing and follow-on commercialization."

Polypropylene was selected as it has inherently good physical properties and low permeability that will limit chemical migration from the outside, addressing one critical factor impacting water quality. Covalently bonding the antioxidant to the polymer backbone will address the other issue with water quality, which is migration of the conventional antioxidant out of the plastic and into the water. The proposed solution has broad applicability to food contact applications that use polypropylene. The Phase I program will address the production and characterization of the antioxidant-modified polypropylene material.

Either on-site treatment process would significantly reduce the need for transporting contaminated waste and materials to an off-site treatment facility; a process that has inherent safety risks and costs. Room-scale decontamination demonstration tests will be performed with a unique, highly robust, inexpensive ClO2 gas generating system and with a novel HAD system to determine efficacy against Phi6 bacteriophage (a surrogate to the Ebola virus). Bench-scale and full-scale testing will be performed to
demonstrate the ability of these decontamination processes to inactivate viruses in both non-porous and porous

There is the need for fabrication techniques for scalable 3D Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) Structures for Quantum Information Systems. In this proposal we will develop an additive manufacturing approach to developing superconducting 3D microwave resonators and quantum memories for QIS. Optimized superconducting 3D microwave resonators are needed for shielding Josephson junction qubits at low temperatures. The need is for the highest possible Q-factor to improve the coherence time for cavity-qubit systems, to minimize de-coherence. Here we propose to use 3-D printing of Nb metal to form the 3-D resonator. This approach offers the simultaneous advantages of quick prototyping, ease of change of resonator design, and scalability, both in terms of size and in terms of multiple unit arrays. The process may potentially offer the advantage of compatibility with other fabrication processes needed for Q-bit formation, and may point the way towards integrated fabrication of qubit and resonator system. We will explore resonators made using a powder bed fusion approach with both e-beam and laser melting alternatives available. Material quality, surface quality, and Q-factor will be explored for simple geometries in Phase I along with design of optimized resonator shapes. We will focus on Nb materials. A route which can directly form Nb based SRF microwave shielding cavities would be of direct benefit to QIS qubit shielding. This proposed work has potential to impact the development of practical quantum computing, in terms of improving the potential for scale-up of quantum computing circuits to practical level devices. The potential applications of quantum computers are vast, and difficult to project. However, they have strong potential to influence many aspects of computing for science, for security, and eventually for commercial purposes. Applications of quantum computing are likely to be either in the area of security or science. The first applications of quantum computing will almost certainly be scientific computation where simulations may be the first application, in the long run, quantum computing has the potential to change the face of computation relevant to vast parts of the economy."

Low reflective coatings (with reflectivity of ~0.1% or less) in the broad spectral range (visible- near infrared) have to be developed. These black coatings should also withstand aggressive space environments and launch conditions with marginal impact on their adhesion and optical performance. A promising candidate with an outstanding diffuse absorptance is chemically vapor deposited layers of carbon nanotubes. However, these coatings are typically grown by expensive and thermally based techniques and can be difficult to apply to 3D structures. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, efficient and scalable manufacturing process for the deposition of durable, low reflectivity CNT black coatings based on the use of pulse and pulse reverse electrophoretic deposition. This technology will enable the conformal deposition of CNT black coatings on complex shapes and sharp edges on commonly used spacecraft materials such as aluminum and titanium substrates. In Phase I, Faraday will develop an electrophoretic bath formulation and manipulate the pulsed electric field parameters to deposit dense, vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes onto test substrates, and characterize the deposited coatings to show the potential of achieving the desired reflectivity of 0.1% or less, monitor the thickness uniformity and morphology and demonstrate the potential for durability in severe launch conditions. Finally, a preliminary techno-economic will be completed to show the potential to reduce the cost of existing processes while maintaining required optical properties. Phase II would optimize the deposition parameters, elucidate their effect on scattered light suppression and thermal-structural performance, process alpha-scale components, and, to the extent possible, perform a system-level validation."

As common sources of protein, such as fishmeal and fish processing byproducts, are becoming limited and more expensive to use, feed producers have turned to plant-based proteins. Plant-based feeds however, come with their own complications, including the need for supplementation with proteins, vitamins and amino acids needed for fish survival and growth, and the requirement to remove natural anti-nutritional factors during processing. For the proposed project Guild BioSciences will utilize our patented immobilized enzyme platform to develop an enzyme-based additive for soybean meal feeds that 1) can maintain effectiveness after being blended into pelleted feed at the point of manufacture, 2) removes anti-nutritional factors related to soybean meal after the feed has been ingested, 3) does not adversely affect the health of the fish, and 4) does not adversely affect the aquaculture environment. Feasibility of this effort will be proven through production and in vitro validation of the enzyme-based additive package’s functionality and a demonstration of in vivo efficacy of a fully formulated feed containing the additive package using rainbow trout.SUMMARY OF ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The proposed additive package will augment the quality of current processed soybean meal containing aquafeeds, and is expected to improve the production performance, digestibility, and physiological response of fish. The improved digestibility will lead to less aquatic pollution as most of the nutrients will now be utilized by the fish instead of excreted. On a cost per unit protein basis the additive will make soybean meal a more attractive protein source than fishmeal for most farmed finfish. Completion of the proposed project will enlarge the portfolio of feed ingredients available to the feed industry and promote U.S. grown soy."

Grant applications are sought to develop new or improved superconducting wire for high field magnets that operate at 16 Tesla (T) field and higher. Nb3Sn is still the primary superconductor being used for the CERN upgrade, the HL-LHC project, and is presently considered as the baseline superconductor for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) design study. The minimum target non-Cu Jc for a potential FCC should be greater than 1500 A/mm2at 16T-4.2K. The above target performance is much beyond the present state-of-the-art. There is a need for 40% improvement of Jc. A simple extrapolation and improvement of existing strand architectures will not be sufficient, a quantum improvement in performance andanevolutionary change in technology is required. We have been working on creating ternary artificial pinning centers (APC) for the tube type Nb3Sn strands which has successfully doubled the layer Jcs, with Bk up to 26.4 T, and we have made 61 restack wires with APC that have been drawn down to 0.25 mm with 25 ?m subelements. In this Phase II, we will confirm the new methods to make ternary APC wires by doping in the APC tube type Nb3Sn strands. We will continue to optimize the Ternary wire including the selection of precursors, the precursor (e.g., Sn/Cu/oxide) ratios, the I.D./O.D. of Nb-alloy tubes, the powder packing density and the powder quality, thereby increasing non-Cu Jc to 2100 A/mm2 at 15 T 4.2 k and 1600 A/mm2 at 16 T 4.2 k, which will be above the FCC specification. We will make higher count restack strand to get 35 µm filaments at 0.7 mm diameter strand. Commercial applications and other benefits: The other commercial applications of this advanced Nb3Sn strands are high field 7-11T MRI, NMR systems, superconducting accelerators - protron radiation for cancer treatment, SMES, and high field magnetic separation. According to a U.S. EPA article, more than 97% of the 15,000 accelerators in use around the world have commercial applications, e.g. in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the locating of oil and minerals in the earth, the processing of semiconductor chips for computers, determination of the age of materials through radiocarbon dating, the sterilizing of medical equipment and food products."

As such, innovative thermal management technologies must be developed to keep pace with the increasing thermal demands and allow tactical aircraft to effectively perform their missions. Development of novel thermal management methods will be a lynch pin for incorporating high-energy electronics and lasers on future and current aircraft. Carbon dioxide has advantages as a working fluid in vapor compression cycle with higher specific heat and much higher volumetric heat density. The higher volumetric heat density reduces the size of the components such as the condenser, evaporator and compressor, resulting in improved size, weight, power and performance. A carbon dioxide vapor compression cycle is being proposed for its flexibility in operation, ability to be expanded, and volumetric reduction of potentially 80%."

Recent manufacturing trends are increasingly focused on additive manufacturing (AM) methods as a way to reduce lead time, cost, and to improve part performance. Current additive manufacturing techniques are unable to fabricate parts in 7000 series aluminum alloys due to a lack of ideal thermal control to prevent defects. To address this, Optonicus proposed the use of an adaptive fiber-array laser system as the energy source for Laser Additive Manufacturing of Seven Thousand Series Aluminum Alloy Components (LAM-STAAC). Integration of this multi-beam laser source into a powder bed fusion system will provide flexibility in controlling the laser intensity distribution on the powder bed material. This will allow enhanced control of the thermal gradients during material processing to generate components that cost less, perform better, last longer, is lighter weight and cannot be manufactured any other way."

Current 2nd generation Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) superconductor already has the stability and performance level meeting, and potentially exceeding the requirements of fusion magnets that operate in medium fields and temperatures. With expected further advances in materials, and technological and engineering aspects, combined with commercial-scale manufacturing capability enabled by Hyper Tech’s continuous tube forming and filling process, MgB2is arguably the only superconductor that could offer the performance of Nb3Sn at NbTi pricing in medium term, and therefore is a viable and logical candidate for incorporation into future fusion systems.

The approach allows the definition of an optimization problem where different types of optimization variables and constraint functions can be simultaneously introduced. We have clearly established the importance of nonlinearity for thin-walled structures operating under thermal loading and have shown that while nonlinearity may not play a significant role for purely in-plane responses, they critically impact every aspect of responses involving out-of-plane deformation: displacement, stress distribution, and stability.

The most significant issues affecting Li-S batteries are related to the dissolution of sulfur in the cathode and migration of lithium polysulfides in organic liquid electrolyte used in the cell, resulting in reduced sulfur utilization and capacity fading over time/cycling. The proposed work seeks to develop Li-S cell materials that address these challenges to enable high energy density storage."

Fields greater than 20T can only be achieved using the High temperature superconductors [Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi-2212) and YBa2Cu3Ox] due to their high upper critical field Hc2. Multifilamentary round Bi-2212/Ag wires have demonstrated many attractive features, such as high irreversibility field (Birr > 100T), isotropic electromagnetic performance, solenoid layer winding, highest engineering critical current density, JE, at fields higher than 20T and compatibility with conventional cabling and strand insulation methods. These advantages make it easy to adapt the well established Nb3Sn technology to make Bi-2212 one of the most promising materials to enable superconducting magnets in the > 20 T range. Even though encouraging reports exist on the suitability of Bi-2212/Ag multifilamentary wires, the R&D efforts for high field magnets are focused on low temperature superconductors mostly due to availability in long continuous lengths with uniform properties. Improving the properties and the piece-length of the Bi-2212 superconductors is of highest importance for the greater use of these materials as possible conductors in magnets for high energy particle colliders. A reliable source of powder with definable properties is needed for the stabilization of the wire manufacturing process, particularly to avoid the JE limiting defects. Performance of a wire depends upon the interplay between powder characteristics, wire drawing process variables and configuration, and thermal processing of the wire. The proposed Small Business Research Program will address key challenges for demonstration scale (>1km lengths) wire for magnets with fields between 25 T to 50T, as well as for production scale (> 3 km) in fields between 16 to 25 T. The SBIR also focuses on improving the JE, of round multifilamentary wires, reduce flaws in long length conductors and reduce cost by improving yield. In this program, powder production will be further optimized to facilitate wire manufacturability on large billet fabrication and enhance wire uniformity. The composition of the powder will be addressed by adding fine secondary phases ("

Platelet transfusion is a critical component for treating such hemorrhage. However, platelets have limited portability, high risk of contamination, and short shelf-life (3-5 days), which severely limit their pre-hospital battlefield use. Improving pre-hospital utilization is currently under investigation with cold-stored and lyophilized platelets, with limited success. In this framework, there is a significant need for an IV-injectable hemostatic product with excellent portability and shelf-life, that enables platelet-mimetic hemostasis when platelets are unavailable. We have developed a synthetic nanoparticle technology, SynthoPlateTM, that can mimic platelets hemostatic functions while allowing large-scale manufacture, sterilization to reduce contamination, long shelf-life and small-volume portability for point-of-injury use. SynthoPlateTM has shown hemostatic and survival benefit in small and large animal trauma models. Building on that, the goal of this proposal is to study SynthoPlateTM stability and biofunction upon lyophilization/reconstitution (Aim 1) and battlefield-relevant environmental exposure (Aim 2), to establish its pre-hospital logistical and functional viability. Additionally, in Aim 3 (Option), the optimal SynthoPlate-to-Platelet ratio will be established for effective hemostatic function. These in vitro studies will guide subsequent pre-clinical Phase II studies with SynthoPlateTM, to significantly advance its potential for pre-hospital hemorrhage control."

Trauma is the leading killer of people aged 1-46, and uncontrollable hemorrhage after injury is the cause of 35% of pre-hospital trauma deaths and 90% of military combat casualties. This is because there are currently no pre-hospital treatment options for internal, non-compressible hemorrhage. If the patient reaches a medical treatment facility in time, the current standard of care is transfusion with blood products, including platelets. However, natural platelet products suffer from shortage in supply (due to donor shortage), difficulty in portability, high risk of bacterial contamination, very short shelf life (3-5 days), requirement of blood typing and cross matching, and multiple biologic side effects (e.g. immune response). Therefore, there exists a significant clinical need for a synthetic platelet surrogate that can address the above limitations and can be administered at point-of-injury or during en route care to stop the bleeding earlier and potentially save lives. Beyond the potential clinical and commercial impact, the proposed research will also provide multi-disciplinary educational and research opportunities in major STEM areas at undergraduate level to create future scientists and engineers. A synthetic platelet technology has been developed that can simulate the hemostatic mechanisms and capabilities of natural platelets while allowing large-scale manufacturing, sterilization, long shelf-life and portability. The technology consists of a platelet-mimetic lipid-based nanoparticle, heteromultivalently surface-decorated with three types of small synthetic peptide ligands that render cooperative mechanisms of binding to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and collagen (platelet-mimetic injury site-selective adhesion mechanisms) and binding to stimulated form of GPIIb-IIIa on active platelets (platelet-mimetic injury site-directed aggregation mechanism). This patented design is unique in that it is currently the only design that combines these adhesion and aggregation properties of natural platelets on a single synthetic platform. Preliminary studies have established the platelet-mimetic functional mechanisms in vitro as well as its significant hemostatic therapy capability in vivo in small (mouse) and large (pig) animal models of hemorrhage in both prophylactic and emergency administration frameworks. Building on these promising results, this project aims to conduct translationally-directed studies to address technical hurdles associated with manufacturing the synthetic platelets with batch-to-batch consistency and long shelf life (>1 year) at a range of storage conditions (widely varying temperatures, altitudes, etc), which would be highly relevant in austere civilian and military applications."

The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, whose drawbacks include high costs, difficulty to scale, biocompatibility issues, and inability to effect switching in application within short times. This new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using readily available adhesive industry infrastructure. Medical adhesive dressings that easily lose peel adhesion addresses a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. MARSI causes about 1.5 million injuries annually in the US alone and it is estimated that MARSI caused $850M in payments withheld to hospitals due to low patient satisfaction.

The proposed Phase 1 SBIR project would evaluate different proprietary multifunctional crosslinkers to increase the speed of the photo-switch by about 50% to meet clinician needs. This would be followed by experimentally evaluating methodologies to fabricate adhesive lined films for optimal optical switchability at different thicknesses and for different substrates. Finally, the learnings from the above two steps about adhesive coated films will be combined with an existing skincare lamp to demonstrate proof of product. Product performance will be characterized and tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.

Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits. Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years.

However, composites cannot be processed like metals and require joining techniques like brazing to obtain complex three-dimensional shapes. Brazing is not the ideal solution, as brazed joint material may not be chemically stable, hermetic, or neutron irradiation tolerant when compared to the base composite material. For example, preferential oxidation can occur due to the lower chemical stability of some brazed joints, resulting in a compromised composite structure.How the Problem is AddressedThis project uses commercially available arc welding technologies for the joining of silicon carbide based ceramics. Arc welding allows the application of heat at the joint, eliminating the need for large furnaces to heat the entire component being manufactured and joined. Sub-components can be fabricated and joined to form complex three-dimensional composite components for next generation nuclear applications.What was Done in Phase IArc welding parameters were developed to weld a silicon carbide-zirconium diboride-zirconium carbide ceramic, and solidification of the weld pool was analyzed. The flexure strength of the joined ceramics were shown to be comparable to current ceramic joining technologies, like brazing. Once arc welding parameters were established, arc welding was used to join flat plates to make a monolithic channel box. Arc welding of monolithics was then transferred to composites, fusion welding of ceramic composites was demonstrated.What is Planned for Phase IIArc welding of ceramics is a relatively foreign concept. In Phase II, the understanding of what can be done and how it can be accomplished will be increased through the welding of new ceramic compositions; weld behavior analysis, such as strength and corrosion resistance; to the modelling of the ceramic arc welding process. Moreover, the development of an autonomous ceramic welding system will increase precision and reliability. Ultimately, for successful acceptance and transition, joining of composites via arc welding techniques will continue to be developed, demonstrated, and refined.Commercial Applications and Other BenefitsThe high temperature tolerance of ceramic matrix composites could allow power upgrades in commercial reactors of as much as 30%, increasing the capacity of existing plants and saving ~$240 million over the lifetime of a plant. An economical, field-deployable welding method will enable robust joining technology that can be widely deployed for the fabrication of complex, three dimensional, silicon carbide based composites for use in Gen IV nuclear reactors."

This requires adequate instrumentation. At the moment, none of electron- or photon-based time-resolved techniques/tools is able to provide GHz-scale sampling rates. Factors limiting sampling rates at light sources are complex, and even if they are solved, limited beam time allocations will still limit the availability of x-ray GHz methods. In ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM), which makes use of a stroboscopic laser-based pump-probe method in which the data are repeatedly collected over extended periods of time, the thermal load from the pump laser must be handled so that the process under study stays reversible. As a result, GHz sampling is not attainable, and the maximum sampling rate is sub- GHz. How the problem is being addressed: A novel laser-free time-resolved GHz stroboscopic concept for TEM would resolve sub-nanosecond processes in advanced magnetic, electronic, ionic and photonic materials/devices, driven by electromagnetic stimuli, under actual operation conditions. In the family of time-resolved electron probe methods, such a laser-free GHz stroboscopic concept would fulfill a different temporal landscape that is complementary to the existing commercial solutions. What was done in Phase II: In Phase II, we completed the fabrication of the first prototype Electron Buncher system, and have been experimentally debugging it. We have addressed and resolved a number of challenging issues, some unanticipated, permitting us to demonstrate its basic functionality at Euclid’s test facility. The first installation on the real commercial TEM at JEOL Boston facility is scheduled for January 2018. We have signed the first commercial contract for our newly developed Electron Buncher with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Also, two utility patents were submitted during Phase II, with one granted and the second currently pending. What will be done in Phase IIA: In Phase IIA of the project, Euclid Techlabs LLC will improve on the original design that was developed in Phase II, based on the knowledge gained and lessons learned in developing the first prototype. With these improvements, we will develop a robust upgraded version of the Electron Buncher and deliver a solid industrialized product to the market by the end of Phase IIA. We also plan to develop a high frequency RF-based pulse compression column for the commercial UTEM. This new effort is in response to the complementary parameter space (e.g. 20fs, 1e4 electrons per pulse, MHz rep. rate) that our Electron Buncher provides. During Phase IIA, Euclid will increase our efforts to market the developed products. We plan to transition the TEM Electron Buncher and the TEM Pulse Compressor into production mode at the end of Phase IIA. Applications and benefits: Because TEM is a platform for various analytical methods, there are infinite application opportunities in energy and electronics to resolve charge (electronic and ionic) transport, and magnetic, plasmonic and excitonic dynamics in advanced functional materials."

These machines will require X-ray refractive optics with precise dimensional control and smooth surfaces that are capable of handling large heat loads and preservation of the x-ray beam quality. How the problem is being addressed: In this project we will machine refractive lenses out of single crystal diamonds by femtosecond laser pulses. The key advantage of this approach is in the short duration of the laser pulse. Femtosecond pulses only ablate the material and do not lead to thermal fatigue, subsequent crystalline defect formation, and reduction in the quality of X-ray optical properties. With the choice of single crystal diamond for the lens, the scattering on grain boundaries, defects and voids associated with polycrystalline materials currently used will be eliminated and the coherence of the X-rays will be preserved. What was done in Phase I: We fabricated a set of diamond X-ray lenses by fs-laser cutting of various grades of single crystal diamonds. We performed white beam topography to determine which grades of diamond are acceptable for x-ray optics and what damage the fs laser cutting induced on the bulk material. We demonstrated a successful test of lens operation in an x-ray source reimaging configuration at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). We also performed an experiment with a stack of three lenses (compound refractive lens) focusing an undulator source at APS into a ~ 50 x 20 micron spot that approach commercial beryllium lens performance. Finally, we performed diamond slurry polishing of the lens surface. What was done in Phase II: In Phase II we built a custom fs-laser cutter system for complex shapes ablation on diamond surfaces. We developed a post-ablation polishing procedure which produces uniform polishing of the full lens surface. A large number of lenses had been tested at Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. These tests determined that there is a correlated shape error on the order of 1-3 microns. What will be done in Phase IIA: In Phase II we will adjust manufacturing process – both ablation and polishing to decrease the shape error to below 1 micron per APS specs. These lenses will be packaged in stainless steel or copper housing for the beamline – ready compound refractive lens. Applications and benefits: The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. Diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the heat load of the next generation light sources. If an inexpensive manufacturing method is established, diamond refractive optics would supersede the current alternative, which is based on beryllium and has safety concerns as well as a lower performance."

This allows the charge to drain off rather than being accumulated in the material.
What was done in Phase I: In Phase I, we synthesized ceramic material based on Mg,Ti oxides having a very low dielectric loss at microwave frequencies and exhibiting two orders (100 times) of magnitude increased conductivity.

One big challenge for depositing a coating on aluminum is that a special pretreatment is required owing to aluminum’s highly reactive nature. Even though the electroless nickel coating has been the most successful thus far for Neutrino Focusing Horns, the complexity and environmental concerns regarding the large amounts of hazard chemical usage for pretreatment have triggered the need for a different process. This program is developing a simple, electrochemical approach that consists of sequential pretreatment and electrodeposition process steps to clean and prepare the aluminum surface and subsequently directly electrodeposit a hard nickel coating on the aluminum horn surface. The coating process is more cost effective, less complex and uses a smaller volume of chemicals than the electroless nickel coating for aluminum Neutrino Focusing Horns. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of pulse reverse electrochemical pretreatment followed by direct electrodeposition of nickel onto aluminum. The entire process comprised 5 steps in comparison to the 16 steps required for electroless nickel deposition. The potential was shown to meet the required properties for adhesion, hardness, and corrosion. Preliminary estimates show the potential for at least a 50% cost saving compared to electroless nickel for a sub-scale component, with more significant savings anticipated for full-size parts. The Phase II project will further develop and validate an electrodeposited nickel coating with similar or better performance than the current electroless nickel coating. Phase II will optimize the pretreatment process to facilitate low-cost manufacturing, optimize the electrodeposition process to achieve the desired wear and corrosion resistance and hardness, design racking and tooling and build alpha-scale electrochemical cells to achieve the desired coating uniformity across the part and process prototype-size components, and finalize the economics and transition plan.Commercial Applications and Other Benefits
Direct electroplating on aluminum alloys is of critical importance to industry. The proposed electrodeposition technology has the potential to positively impact society by reducing hazard chemical usage, and enhance the usage of the aluminum in various applications. The technology will be adapted to other applications that require electrodeposited coatings on passive metals such as aluminum, titanium and stainless steels."

Antimonide-based Type II Superlattice (T2SL) infrared (IR) detectors have made significant advances in the past decade. The interest in this technology stems from (1) the ability to tailor the T2SL bandgaps across the IR region and (2) the manufacturability of T2SL structures using III-V foundries and horizontal integration schemes. &nbsp;&nbsp;NASA researchers have been involved with efforts to develop T2SL IR detectors for a variety of space-related missions, both in communications and sensing. We propose to complete a fundamental feasibility study leading to a prototype of a single pixel, field programmable, SWIR photodetector. This detector will use antimonide-based T2SL materials as the absorber. This detector will operate at relative high temperature (above 250&nbsp;K). Most uniquely, this detector&rsquo;s voltage bias can be programmed to operate with either high dynamic range or high sensitivity. High dynamic range uses a low voltage bias (&lt;1&nbsp;V) and operates the detector in a standard PIN configuration. High sensitivity uses a high voltage bias (20 to 30&nbsp;V) and operates in the linear amplification region of an avalanche photodiode (APD). The detector is engineered for high signal-to-noise operation in both modes. The user or the control software can adaptively trade off dynamic range versus sensitivity on the fly and in response to measured characteristics of the scene (for example, photon flux or noise conditions). This detector will work ideally with an emerging generation of readout integrated circuits that will control the voltage of pixels selectively, leading to a focal plane array (FPA) that can algorithmically decide the operational mode of each pixel.

This comes to no surprise, as the accelerating waveguide is a set of diamond – turned copper resonators brazed together. Such a multistep manufacturing process is not only expensive, but also prone to manufacturing errors, which decrease the production yield. In the big picture, the cost of the accelerating waveguide precludes the use of accelerators as a replacement option for radioactive sources. This is especially true for systems intended for operation in an environment with electricity, temperature, humidity, and water supply issues. Ultimately, an inexpensive and robust accelerator is needed. Euclid Techlabs LLC proposes a revolutionary brazeless accelerating structure made out of copper-plated stainless steel or tungsten cells, with copper irises serving as gaskets for vacuum and RF seals. Skipping the brazing step and using stainless steel components reduces the costs compared to copper. Because of a higher radiation screening efficiency for stainless steel or tungsten, the shielding weight is also reduced. Brazeless design allows the addition of cooling channels and embedded focusing magnets for performance optimization. Embedded focusing/steering elements allow for a small bore, lower current focusing coil for a significant weight and space reduction. In Phase I we designed and fabricated a full-featured brazeless accelerating structure with microwave coupler. Field balance tuning was first demonstrated in a low power test. Then a vacuum test was performed, followed by high power testing (conditioning) of the structure. The structure was conditioned to a 10 MV/m gradient. There was no damage observed to the copper-plated surfaces, and minor multipactor-related damage was found on structure irises. This was the shortest turnaround time for a high power microwave R&D effort on the smallest budget in our 15 years of experience. In Phase II, we will produce and test several designs for a few MeV accelerator based on this brazeless design approach. A field-emission or thermal electron gun will be incorporated into the design. The ultimate goal is to produce a very inexpensive few MeV electron accelerator. Besides high power tests at our R&D facility in Bolingbrook, IL, we plan to perform an ultra-high power test at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The high gradient accelerator community may also benefit from the fast turnaround testing of various materials and geometries based on this brazeless design. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Besides the industrial application, this robust and inexpensive accelerator will find application as a replacement for radioactive isotopes for use as an irradiation source. Due to increased regulations imposed by US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), there are additional indirect expenses associated with radionuclide-based sources. These expenses are associated with the disposal of the radionuclide source of the irradiator. The proposed inexpensive design makes radiation-on-demand accelerator–based gamma ray sources commercially viable."

Moreover, it is to commercialize the solutions that will make these savings possible. This is important because geothermal HVAC systems are the most energy-efficient heating/cooling system known, according to the DOE. But the technology has not gone mainstream because of the higher first cost compared to conventional HVAC systems. The incremental cost of geothermal over conventional HVAC systems is typically 40-80% and mostly if not entirely due to the bore-field. This is because drilling 100-500 feet bore-holes is costly when the geology can vary from site to site and the appropriate drilling equipment and/or professional experience may or may not be readily available. Our goal is to reduce the incremental cost of geothermal by 50% or more and thereby better ensure the energy savings achieve a net positive cash flow for the owner. While the current tax credits of 30% for residential and 10% for commercial are helpful, these incentives will expire in the next 5 years so the industry needs to achieve a lower first cost basis to continue growing and eventually become the preferred heating/cooling system for home and building owners. At present, geothermal only has about 1-3% of the total HVAC market. Our Phase 1 research shows that the size of the geothermal bore-field can be reduced up to 40% by optimizing the design/layout of the bore-field and utilizing phase-change materials (PCMs) in or around the water loop. More specifically, by eliminating bore-holes in the center of the bore-field, ground heat transfer can be improved such that 10-30% fewer bore-holes are necessary. And by adding PCMs in a holding tank or in the bore-hole grout, the number of bore-holes can be reduced another 5-10%. Therefore, two commercial products have been proposed to achieve these bore-field size reductions: (1) Bore-field design software that encourages engineers and contractors to design long or donut- shaped bore-fields to improve heat transfer and thereby minimize the number of bore-holes; (2) PCM tanks (direct heat exchange plus water mass) and/or infused grout (indirect heat exchange) that store and release energy on a seasonal basis to further minimize the number of bore-holes. We are very excited and motivated to significantly improve our nation’s economy, health, resiliency, and security through this grant opportunity.Thank you for your consideration."

Although the current state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cell anode consisting of nickel and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) has excellent catalytic properties and stability for the H2 oxidation at the usual operation conditions, the use of Ni-YSZ anode with carbon containing fuels results in the deposition of large quantities of carbon on the nickel surface, resulting in a marked irreversible reduction of cell performance. Our approach is to replace Ni with a predominantly single phase multi-principal element alloy. Multi- principal element alloys (MPEAs) are a new alloy development strategy, where the base alloy has significant atom fractions of several elements. We propose to combine 3-5 elements to form a MPEA and make cermet with YSZ for the anode. In Phase I, we performed thermodynamic calculations to determine composition ranges for solid-solution alloys using 3-5 elements selected from their catalytic properties and potential for coking resistance. Selected alloys were fabricated and composited with YSZ to form MPEA-YSZ anode by both powder processing and magnetron sputtering methods. CH4-steam reforming tests showed that the reforming rate on MPEA-YSZ remains lower than on conventional Ni-YSZ as proposed during tests performed at 750°C. Carbon formation was not observed in post-test MPEA-YSZ by scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. In Phase II, we will develop electrochemical and thermal models of the cell in its stack environment for selected MPEA compositions, which can provide the basis for tailoring the anode composition. Electrochemical testing and performance analysis will be done on button cells fabricated using the optimized composition of selected alloys and compared with the performance of the base line cell. Further testing will be performed with gas mixtures more representative of natural gas to avoid the need for a supplemental conventional pre-reformer."

In this project, an integrated process will be developed to produce n-butanol from cellulosic biomass and waste gas streams using two engineered clostridial strains, one butanol-tolerant solventogenic strain and one carboxydotrophic acetogen, co-immobilized in a “Linear Immobilized Bioreactor” (LIBR). The CO2 and H2 produced by the solventogenic strain will be used by the carboxydotrophic strain to produce acetate (and butyrate) that in turns can be used by the solventogenic strain to produce more butanol. Such a co- cultured fermentation has the potential to increase butanol production from biomass hydrolysate sugars by up to 50% with 100% reduction in CO2 emission. Butanol produced in the fermentation will be stripped by the rising bubbles of fermentation produced gases (CO2 and H2) in the LIBR and separated via a condenser, alleviating butanol inhibition while achieving continuous butanol production at a high productivity and product titer, which can reduce both water and energy consumptions by over 50% compared to conventional ethanol and ABE fermentation processes. Phase I study will prove the new bioprocess concept and verify our hypothesis that the proposed LIBR and co-cultured fermentation can enhance the conversion of lignocellulosic sugars to butanol with higher butanol yield, productivity and titer, leading to reduced biobutanol cost to compete more favorably with bioethanol and fossil fuels. A prototype lab-scale LIBR for multiphase fermentation will be constructed to investigate and demonstrate the technical feasibility and advantages of the LIBR for multiphase fermentation involving sugars and gaseous substrates. The LIBR will be optimized and evaluated for its economic feasibility for biobutanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and industrial waste gases in Phase II."

High brightness beams essentially consist of a large number of electrons in a small phase space volume, i.e. a high peak current. When such beams are generated from the cathode, there is a strong space charge force, which elongates the bunch and reduces its brightness. An optimal solution is to raise the accelerating voltage in the gun; however, the maximum gradient is limited by the effects of RF breakdown. The probability of RF breakdown is reduced as the RF pulse length decreases. We propose to develop an electron photo injector operating with short RF pulses. However, standing-wave cavities are inefficient to operate at short RF pulse lengths. For this reason, the proposed gun will consist of high peak gradient cathode half-cell with low loaded Q-factor, followed by a travelling-wave accelerating section, which is more efficient operating at short RF pulse lengths. In Phase I, we will design a gun prototype in X-band. This effort will include RF design, beam quality optimization, and engineering design. The design will be based on a short RF pulse generated at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility for two-beam acceleration experiments. We will manufacture an aluminum prototype to measure its microwave properties, most importantly, fill time. The proposed short RF pulse gun is an effective high gradient electron source fed by short RF pulses. These pulses can be formed by radar magnetrons with compact pulse compression systems that have a short delay line. The high brightness beam source can be used as the main beam in wakefield accelerators. It will find commercial applications in ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy systems."

A need has been identified for technologies to enable solid-liquid separation associated with cellulosic nanomaterials production, “as cellulosic nanomaterials are not economical to ship long distances while containing significant water content”. This cost represents a critical driver for capital, energy, shipping, and resource costs of nanocellulose products. Interest has been expressed in the development of a technology for dewatering of cellulosic nanomaterials, which can be dried and redispersed without any changes in functional properties. The operation is anticipated to be one of the candidate electrochemical ‘dewatering’ technologies among ElectroDecomposition of water or ElectroConcentration. This program will investigate these electro-assisted dewatering technologies against performance constraints and develop individual cost models, including the candidate dewatering technology utilizing pulsed waveforms to achieve separation of cellulosic nanomaterials from its suspension. The cost models will be designed to interface with an overarching optimization tool, to identify a promising technology.

Integrated optic lithium niobate modulators based on annealed proton exchange (APE) are typically used in these systems. However, APE waveguides suffer from temperature and time dependent frequency response because they are produced through a relatively low temperature ion exchange process. Higher temperature Ti-diffused processes yield relatively stable waveguides, but suffer from non-flat frequency response and photorefractive effects. Thus, there remains a need for electro-optic modulators with flat and stable frequency response over the decades of life span of the sensor system.

Accurate monitoring of this fuel injection rate is important as it can provide the instantaneous feed information to the boiler and thereby the instantaneous combustion efficiency of the boiler can be ascertained. In a commercial coal-fired system, the coal injection to the pulverized combustor is made at multiple locations of the boiler through multiple injecting pipes connecting to the central coal hopper. The total feed rate to the boiler can be readily measured from the discharge rate from the central coal hopper. However, their precise distribution from the central hopper to each injecting pipe is usually not known. Knowing the instantaneous coal injection rate in the pipe to the boiler is essential to providing timely action to correct for maldistribution and ensure sufficient air- to-coal flow ratio is provided for complete combustion. The current detection of maldistribution of the coal feeding from the central hopper is based on the mal-performance of downstream combustion system performance such as low steam generation rate. Clearly, a delay in detection of the feeder maldistribution can affect the prolonged low boiler efficiency and hence economics of the boiler system. Tech4Imaging, LLC (T4I) will develop a capacitance-based feed forward real- time control system for measuring mass flow rates of feedstock for flex-fuel mode power plant operations. This Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) multi-phase flow meter project will result in a commercially viable solution for adjusting inlet fuel feed based on online, real-time evaluation and measurement to control power generation efficiencies that will result in lower total operating costs. In addition, the system will be designed to operate in remote areas, and operation will not require highly-specialized training, thus allowing for employment of a locally available labor force. The proposed combination of capacitance sensors, with their proven ability to measure multiple flow components, in conjunction with software developed to assess these measurements as an operational control measure, will enable more control of power plant operations. In Phase I of this project, we will focus on the development of algorithms to determine volume fractions and velocities of multiple phases, and validation of measurements on a controlled multi-phase flow loop.

Moreover, well information is especially crucial when operating a geothermal plant in a dispatchable mode because changes in well operations performed in accordance with oscillating energy demands could potentially cause even greater damage to exploited wells. We propose a solution for this challenging problem by developing a data fusion algorithm that will serve as an analysis tool for operating current geothermal power plants in a flexible mode. This innovative solution will combine enthalpy measurements from our TRL 6 two-phase mass flow meters with other well performance metrics (such as pressure, temperature, wellhead scaling, power demand, and costs of operation/curtailment of each well) to optimize well operations, thereby enabling geothermal energy to be more widely deployed as a dispatchable electricity source. Phase I key outcomes will be a functioning field-tested prototype sensor that can withstand the harsh conditions of the geothermal surface pipelines for long term deployment, an algorithm that calculates two phase mass flow rates of steam and water using measurements from the sensor, and an algorithm for how the mass flow, enthalpy measurements and other well performance metrics can be used to optimize the efficiency of a dispatchable geothermal plant when operating in flexible mode. In Phase I of this project, we will validate our solution for dispatchable geothermal operations by field testing using our mass flow sensor at operational geothermal wells. We have agreements with two geothermal well owners to host this testing. Mass flow and enthalpy measurements will be taken inline and validated against tracer flow tests (TFTs) conducted by an independent geothermal company. Results of the testing, as well as sample well performance data, will be used to iterate algorithm development until a satisfactory level of thoroughness and accuracy has been reached as validated by an independent geothermal company."

Proposed effort attempts to provide a machine learning based platform that would guide the design of nanocatalytic materials for a variety of applications, beginning with the use of case of chloro-organic contaminant remediation. The current approaches either use conventional molecular dynamics coupled with ab initio approaches to uncover reaction kinetics or machine learning platforms that neglect or under-estimate the soft epitaxy between adsorbant and surface. Using reactive descriptors sourced from MD trajectories with validated potentials, the artificial neural networks will have molecular imprint information key to catalytic pathways. This would elucidate reactive sites using descriptors that eschew the more computationally expensive DFT approaches, leading to larger phase exploration and more translatable models. The artificial neural network models would be based on reactivity descriptors that are very specific to the molecular geometry and nanoparticle feature size. Sensitivity analyses would be done to improve the initial training of data sets for a similar set of contaminants. Robustness of the model would be tested by running the models on a dissimilar system. Finally, hypothetical nanomaterials and facets would be proposed to experimental collaborators."

Thomson scattering (TS) at tens of Hz has routinely measured electron temperature (Te) and electron number density (ne) inside the plasma system. However, at these data rates traditional TS can obtain only a sparse data set, which significantly limits in catching the plasma dynamics. Improved diagnostics with high temporal resolution are highly desired, as outlined at the 2015 Fusion Energy Science Workshop on Plasma Material Interactions and Workshop on Transients. Spectral Energies proposes to develop and commercialize hundreds-of-kHz-rate microwave and tens-of-kHz-rate Thomson scattering instruments based on diode and flashlamp-pumped burst-mode laser systems. Burst-mode lasers could be designed and operate in high-speed (up to MHz rates) or high-power (up to 2 Joule/pulse). Two key commercial products will be developed: 1) High-speed microwave scattering system for key atomic species (H & D) and electron number density and 2) High-speed Thomson scattering system for electron number density and electron temperature. The new improved diagnostics high-repetition-rates will enable unprecedented diagnostic capabilities and understanding for plasma instabilities, plasma wall interactions, and edge plasma characterizations and control. In Phase I, major research efforts will focus on demonstration of in-situ quantitative microwave and Thomson scattering from thermal plasma systems by optimizing the laser for pulse energy along with duration, shape, spacing, and wavelength to suppress the background scattering and stray light. The proposed techniques will be applied (possibly in Phase II) in the Prototype Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (Proto-MPEX) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) or possibly at the Lithium Tokamak eXperiement Beta (LTX-Beta) device at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)"

Zinc is plentiful in the U.S. and zinc-air batteries have the potential to hold more than five times the energy of current lithium-ion batteries, but a key challenge for making rechargeable zinc-air batteries is that the zinc inside the battery naturally forms sharp needles called dendrites during recharging. Over time these dendrites can grow large enough to damage the inner workings of the battery, reducing efficiency and lifetime. This project will borrow principles from an adjacent field, the electroplating industry, to create new organic chemicals that will seek out and stop dendrite growth within the battery during recharging. Chemical additives have a long history in electroplating for controlling the shape of metal surfaces, and the same principles can apply to additives designed here to control zinc growth during battery recharging. This new technology will make zinc-air batteries cheaper and longer-lasting to eventually replace existing battery technologies, enabling longer-distance electric vehicles, reducing equipment weight for soldiers, contributing a valuable technology to the economy, and helping to maintain the role of the U.S. as a leader in energy storage technology. This STTR Phase I project will identify the critical chemistry necessary to elegantly and economically suppress zinc dendrite formation, alleviating one of the most significant challenges complicating the full commercial emergence of Zn-Air battery technology. Eschewing the established tactic of applying existing chemicals from the catalog, this project will take inspiration from the PI?s experience designing additives for similar environments in the electroplating industry to introduce novel proprietary organic chemistry addressing the dendrite bottleneck directly. The key technical challenge will be to optimize the molecular features to simultaneously provide efficient dendrite suppression and low voltage loss. A broad series of molecules will be created to combine strong interactions with zinc, modest polarization, low cost and straightforward scalability. Evaluating and iterating upon these candidates in bench-scale electrochemical analyses and performance tests in coin and pouch cell batteries will yield a dendrite-suppressing product to bring significant value to Zn-Air technology and other Zn-based battery markets. At its successful conclusion, this project will not only produce products for these markets, but it will also provide molecular design principles useful for the development of other metal-based battery additives, and promote the merits of novel additive development for the broader battery industry."
