# Wow! It's 90 degrees Fahrenheit and you are sweating buckets! Luckily you have air conditioning,
# but it's really old and kind of finicky. It cools the room by three degrees and shuts off, so you have
# to keep turning it back on until the temperature gets to where you want it to be. Seventy five
# sounds much more pleasant than 90, so that's what you're shooting for.

# While the temperature is greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit, print "The temperature
# is XX â€” crank the AC!" and subtract 3 degrees from the temperature.
# Once the temperature is cool enough and the loop is done, print "75. Ahh, that's
# better."

roomTemp = 90

while roomTemp > 75:
    print("The temperature is ",roomTemp,"- crank the AC!")
    roomTemp -= 3

print("75. Ahh, that's better.")
